# ABISanitizer Proof-of-Concept

This is a minimal PoC for ABISan.

# Running

1. `make`
2. Use a hex editor to replace the first two instructions in f with a call to abisan_f_instrumentation_entry
3. `./test`, and observe that the program exits 1 because rbx was clobbered.

# Next steps

- Support dynamic linking
- Automate the patching
- Print a useful error message.
